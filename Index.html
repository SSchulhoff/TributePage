  <p>I use Python, C, and Google Apps Script most often for work and school. 
    I have developed websites with HTML, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, and MaterializeCSS and 
    Bootstrap. I enjoy working with APIs like Wikipedia and Google Suites. I have worked
    with Adobe XD, Figma, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator to develop a number of logos, 
    miscellaneous art, and site designs. I have read books like Deep Learning with Python,
    Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (Sutton and Barto), and An Introduction to 
    Information Theory. I enjoy experimenting with RL problems and hope to eventually 
    apply what I learn to space travel, space mining, and planetary development. 
    I have worked with PHP, MySQL, Bash, Objective-C, C++, C#, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, 
    PyCharm, Visual Studio, VS Code, Atom, Juptyper Notebook(s), Google Colab, XCode, 
    MAMP, SQLPro, PHPMyAdmin, Unity, GDrive Scripting Environment, Mongo DB, discord.js, 
    discord.py, Swift, Clasp, NPM,... and a bunch of others.</p>
